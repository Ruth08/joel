  <h3>How does Outsource Live Chat Support do ?</h3>
  <p>chat support is pre-configured, easy to install and does not require additional modules or add-ons to be installed by the visitor. It uses functionalities available in any modern browser by default.</p>
  <p>When a visitor to your website requires assistance of any kind, all they have to do is click on the "click-to-chat" button prominently placed on your website. This will initiate a live chat session with a customer care executive, who will provide real-time answers to the customer's queries, and also cross-sell and up-sell your products and services in the process.</p>
